The infamous and clich√© initial post `Hello World` =P

Saying "Hello World" and exposing your creation on the internet is one of the basic programming premises for everyone who is starting to code.

In the midst of the COVID19 pandemic and stuck inside my home, there was no better time to stop postponing and start writing a little bit and relearn writing non-machine code.

And why this site/blog? Firstly to register experiments/experience, some ideas, a little music, and who knows to help other people.

That's all folks!
